Greetings, fellow astronauts,

Life can sometimes take unexpected turns, and due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to begin working on the project yesterday as planned. I started early this morning and, while this is not the final result, I wanted to share my current progress.

The concept I’m developing is more complex than what I’ve submitted so far, but I believe there is already value in the way I’ve structured and architected the code.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your consideration regarding the timing.

Best regards,
Carlos lopez

## technical debt
- Detail and filters
- 3D animations
- Complete all the steps - to have a readme

## Note
This app was build using firebase, for that reason i will leave here the link to be able to test the code.

## Promt
I would like to make a big refactor in order to take advandtages from riverpod, i want to use just one controller, to be especific planet_filter_controller to feed my widget tree, also i would like to make the filter logic inside in that main controller, and add de methods to the facade/planet_repository.dart - the main goal is to make easier to read and elimanate as much code ass possible, tell me how we start to do that and also sustaining clean architecture approach.

I would like that planet_filter_bar.dart - use a text size responsive and related to global theme, but i would like to make that widget smaller as posible - also there is a probleme with the Volume range the max value is not the right one, please check that to validate that the max volume it is in jupiter, fix that issue, also add and animation that show the widget from top to button when i press the icon search and reverse animation if i hit the close icon.

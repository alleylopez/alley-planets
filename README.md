Greetings, fellow astronauts,

The concept I’m developing is more complex than what I’ve submitted so far, but I believe there's already value in the way I’ve structured and architected the code. I’d also like to mention that the overall experience using Riverpod was great. I would love to receive your feedback on how I’ve used it so I can continue learning from this experience.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your consideration regarding the timing.

Best regards,
Carlos Lopez

## Technical Debt

* **Detail and filters**: Preview available, but requires more work to fully match the intended functionality.
* **Favorites**: Planning to implement using SharedPreferences.
* **Deep linking**: Not working as intended — e.g., it fails to correctly handle `/planets/planet-error.png`.

## Note

This app was built using Firebase.
For that reason, I’m providing a link to test the code. You'll also need a set of instructions for inserting data into Firestore using Postman.

> The assets used in this project are not from the API provided. I used **SORA** to generate high-quality images (800x800 pixels). These images are included as assets in the project and are also stored in Firestore.

There are some practices in the current codebase that I plan to improve over time. This is a small project for now, but I envision evolving it into an educational game to help people learn physics.

Let me know if you want this translated into Spanish or formatted for publishing (e.g., for GitHub).

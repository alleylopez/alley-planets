Greetings, fellow astronauts,

Life can sometimes take unexpected turns, and due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to begin working on the project yesterday as planned. I started early this morning and, while this is not the final result, I wanted to share my current progress.

The concept I’m developing is more complex than what I’ve submitted so far, but I believe there is already value in the way I’ve structured and architected the code.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your consideration regarding the timing.

Best regards,
Carlos lopez
